# Test fixture: basic SSH config for parser tests.
#
# This file provides a minimal but representative SSH configuration used by
# internal/config/parser_test.go and any other tests that need a realistic
# SSH config to parse.
#
# It exercises the following parser features:
#   - Wildcard Host block ("Host *") providing default directives to all hosts.
#   - Concrete Host block ("Host web") with explicit overrides.
#   - Common directives: User, HostName, Port, LocalForward.
#   - Directive merging: "web" should inherit User=deploy from the wildcard
#     block, then override Port with 2222 and add a LocalForward rule.
#
# To use this fixture in a test, copy it to a temp directory and call
# config.ParseFile() with the copied path. Do NOT parse this file in-place,
# as tests should never depend on the repository's working directory layout.
